Spring Boot:
Spring Boot is a framework for building production-grade applications using the
Spring platform. It takes an "opinionated" view of the Spring ecosystem and
third-party libraries, providing a set of defaults that streamline the development
process and get you up and running quickly.
Here are some of the key reasons to use Spring Boot:
● Simplicity: Spring Boot eliminates the need for a lot of boilerplate
configuration, making it much quicker to get started with your project. You can
create a basic Spring Boot application with just a few lines of code.
● Productivity: Spring Boot provides a wide range of auto-configuration features
that take care of common tasks like setting up a web server, connecting to a
database, and configuring security. This frees you up to focus on writing the
core logic of your application.
● Embedded server: Spring Boot applications can be run with an embedded
server like Tomcat or Jetty, so you don't need to deploy them to a separate
application server. This makes it easier to test and debug your code.
● Spring ecosystem: Spring Boot is fully compatible with the Spring ecosystem,
so you can use all of your favorite Spring libraries and frameworks with it.
● Microservices: Spring Boot is a great choice for building microservices
applications, as its lightweight and modular design makes it easy to develop
and deploy independent services.
In short, Spring Boot is a great option for anyone who wants to build
production-grade Java applications quickly and easily. It's a powerful and versatile
framework that can be used for a wide range of projects.

Here's a comprehensive overview of Spring Boot's architecture and components:
Architecture:
● Layered Architecture: Spring Boot promotes a layered approach, typically consisting of:
○ Presentation Layer: Handles HTTP requests, translates JSON, performs
authentication, and interacts with the business layer.
○ Business Layer: Contains core business logic, service classes, authorization, and
validation.
○ Persistence Layer: Interacts with databases for data storage and retrieval (often
using Spring Data).
● Auto-Configuration: Spring Boot automatically configures common beans and
dependencies based on annotations and classpath settings, reducing boilerplate
configuration.
Key Components:
● Spring Boot Starters: Convenient dependency descriptors that group related libraries
and auto-configuration for common features (e.g., web, data, testing).
● Spring Boot CLI (Command Line Interface): Tool for running and testing Spring Boot
applications from the command line.
● Spring Boot Actuator: Provides production-ready features like health checks, metrics,
and monitoring endpoints.
● Embedded Servlet Container: Spring Boot can embed a web server (Tomcat, Jetty, or
Undertow) for standalone applications, eliminating the need for external deployment.
● Spring Boot Starter Parent: Parent POM that manages common dependencies and
plugin versions for Spring Boot projects.
Internals:
● Spring Core: Foundation for dependency injection, IoC container, and other core Spring

features.
● Spring Web: Provides web MVC framework for building REST APIs and web
applications.
● Servlet API: Standard for Java web applications, often used with Spring Web.
● Grape: Embedded dependency resolution engine for managing JAR dependencies.
Benefits of Spring Boot:
● Rapid Development: Simplifies setup and configuration, allowing faster development.
● Opinionated Defaults: Sets sensible defaults for common configurations, reducing
decision fatigue.
● Production-Ready: Includes features for monitoring, logging, health checks, and metrics.
● Microservices-Friendly: Well-suited for building microservices architectures.
● Testability: Encourages test-driven development and provides easy integration with
testing frameworks.

builds.
○ src/main/java: Contains your Java source code.
○ src/main/resources: Contains configuration files (e.g.,
application.properties).
○ src/test/java: Contains test classes.
4. Configuration:
● Application class: The main class (annotated with @SpringBootApplication)
starts the application.
● application.properties (or application.yml): Sets configuration properties (e.g.,
server port, database connection).
● Auto-configuration: Spring Boot automatically configures features based on
dependencies. Override defaults if needed.
5. Running the Application:
● From IDE: Run the main class.


● Command line:
○ Maven: mvn spring-boot:run
○ Gradle: gradle bootRun
6. Packaging and Deployment:
● Executable JAR: Spring Boot creates an executable JAR containing all
dependencies.
● Deployment: Deploy the JAR to a server or run it standalone.

○ Artifact: my-demo-app
○ Dependencies: Add "Spring Web"
○ Build tool: Choose Maven or Gradle
○ Java version: Select your preferred version
● Generate Project: Click "Generate" and download the project zip file.
● Extract the zip file: Unzip the downloaded project to your workspace.
2. Create Main Application Class:
● Navigate to src/main/java/com/example/mydemoapp: Open this package in
your IDE.
● Create a class named DemoApplication.java: Paste the following code:
Java
package com.example.mydemoapp;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import
org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
@SpringBootApplication
public
class
DemoApplication
{
public

Here's an introduction to Spring Data:
What is Spring Data?
● It's a family of projects within the Spring Framework that aims to simplify data access
across various data stores.
● It provides a consistent programming model and hides the complexities of different
data access technologies.
● It supports both relational (like SQL databases) and non-relational (like MongoDB,
Redis, Neo4j) databases.
Key Features:
● Repository Abstraction:
○ Repositories act as interfaces between your application and the underlying data
store.
○ They provide a collection-like API for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
operations.
○ You define interfaces, and Spring Data dynamically creates implementations.
● Query Derivation:
○ Spring Data can automatically create queries based on method names in your
repository interfaces.
○ Example: findByNameAndAge(String name, int age) would generate an
appropriate query.
● Paging and Sorting:
○ Built-in support for pagination and sorting, enhancing performance and user
experience.
● Custom Queries:
○ You can still define custom queries using JPQL, native SQL, or other query
languages when needed.
Common Spring Data Modules:
● Spring Data JPA: For relational databases, leveraging the Java Persistence API
(JPA).
● Spring Data MongoDB: For MongoDB document databases.
● Spring Data Redis: For Redis key-value store.
● Spring Data Neo4j: For Neo4j graph database.
● Spring Data Cassandra: For Apache Cassandra database.
● Spring Data Elasticsearch: For Elasticsearch search engine.
● ...and more: Covering various other databases and technologies.
Benefits of Using Spring Data:
● Reduced boilerplate code: Streamlines data access with less code to write and
maintain.

● Improved developer productivity: Faster development with simplified data access
operations.
● Consistency across data stores: Provides a unified approach for different types of
databases.
● Testability: Repository interfaces promote loose coupling and make testing easier.
● Integration with Spring ecosystem: Works seamlessly with other Spring projects
like Spring Boot and Spring MVC.
